# Obliteration Compatibility List
  
This is a compatibility list for Obliteration that can freely contributed to by the community, and that includes you!
However, there are some simple rules for your submission to be allowed:

-   You must complete the form as it says to do so.
-   Fill out the title of the issue as so: "NAME - TITLEID", an example of this would be "Amplitude - CUSA02480".
-   Before creating a new issue, search and see if the game has already been reported, and if so, instead reply to the original report with your new information.
-   Do not make spammy or non-game specific reports, such as "When is bloodborne going to work?" or "None of my games work!"
-   If at some point a game has a regression in a newer build of Obliteration, make sure to include the last working version in your report IF possible.
-   Do not upload copyright material, such as .sprx, .prx, eboot.bin, and firmware files.
